# About the project
This project was developped over the fall 2023 semester to explore more of the openCV library and develop a fun game I imagined in my free time. 

I designed everything in the project, including the background drawing.

All the elements in this project are drawn, which I think is very interesting. 

# How To run
1. Navigate to terminal
2. Change the directory to the project directory
3. Compile and run the code using the command below:
-     python3 simplegame.py
